Master Thesis Oyster Mushroom Maturity Identification

This research was conducted at Digit Goslar where the Oyster Mushrooms were grown in the grow chambers and the Raspberry Pis were connected to the chambers to collect and upload to the TU Clausthal's Cloud. The pictures of the Oyster mushrooms are collected hourly and using CVAT, annotated and prepared for the Machine learning algorithm was used to find the solution.
